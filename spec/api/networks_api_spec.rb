  # Get a network
  # Gets information for a network **networkId**.
  # @param network_id The identifier of a network.
  # @param [Hash] opts the optional parameters

The list applies to a returned individual entity or entries within a collection.  If the API method also supports the **include** parameter, then the fields specified in the **include** parameter are returned in addition to those specified in the **fields** parameter.
