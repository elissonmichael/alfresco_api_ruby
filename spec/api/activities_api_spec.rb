  # List activities
  # Gets a list of activities for person **personId**.  You can use the &#x60;-me-&#x60; string in place of &#x60;&lt;personId&gt;&#x60; to specify the currently authenticated user. 
  # @param person_id The identifier of a person.
  # @param [Hash] opts the optional parameters
  # @option opts [Integer] :skip_count The number of entities that exist in the collection before those included in this list.  If not supplied then the default value is 0. 
  # @option opts [Integer] :max_items The maximum number of items to return in the list.  If not supplied then the default value is 100. 
  # @option opts [String] :who A filter to include the user&#39;s activities only &#x60;me&#x60;, other user&#39;s activities only &#x60;others&#x60;&#39; 
  # @option opts [String] :site_id Include only activity feed entries relating to this site.
  # @option opts [Array<String>] :fields A list of field names.  You can use this parameter to restrict the fields returned within a response if, for example, you want to save on overall bandwidth.  The list applies to a returned individual entity or entries within a collection.  If the API method also supports the **include** parameter, then the fields specified in the **include** parameter are returned in addition to those specified in the **fields** parameter.
